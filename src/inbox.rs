//! `/iroh-chat-inbox/1` direct QUIC protocol for offline-message delivery.
//!
//! The inbox protocol runs on a dedicated QUIC ALPN, separate from gossip
//! and whisper.  It carries opaque, already-encrypted [`MailboxEnvelope`](crate::mailbox::MailboxEnvelope)s
//! and signed [`MailboxAck`](crate::mailbox::MailboxAck)s between peers.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! * Every `Deliver` and `Ack` is wrapped in a [`SignedInboxMessage`](crate::inbox::SignedInboxMessage) with
//!   a sender signature and timestamp for replay protection.
//! * The handler rejects messages whose sender is not in the configured
//!   `allowed_senders` set (populated from the contact/friend list).
//! * A clock-skew window (24 hours) prevents replay of old messages.
//! * Duplicate `message_id`s are deduplicated within the replay window.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! * [`InboxProtocol`](crate::inbox::InboxProtocol) — registered as a protocol handler so remote peers
//!   can deliver envelopes to this node.
//! * Received envelopes are forwarded via an mpsc channel to the frontend,
//!   which stores them in the local MailboxStore and broadcasts acknowledgements.
//!
//! # Event-channel semantics (BORU-AUDIT-08)
//!
//! All [`InboxEvent`](crate::inbox::InboxEvent)s are **correctness-critical**: a silently dropped
//! `EnvelopeReceived`, `AckReceived`, `SyncRequested` or
//! `DeleteTombstoneReceived` would lose protocol state that the frontend
//! can only recover by a full resync.  Every event therefore goes through
//! `emit_inbox_event`, which never ignores a channel failure:
//!
//! * a **full** channel rejects the request with an explicit Busy error so
//!   the peer can retry later (`TrySendError::Full`),
//! * a **closed** channel surfaces as an explicit channel-closed error
//!   (`TrySendError::Closed`).
//!
//! Both increment [`INBOX_EVENT_SEND_FAILURES`](crate::inbox::INBOX_EVENT_SEND_FAILURES) so overload is observable
//! and deterministic.  Deliberately lossy channels elsewhere in the app
//! (discovery/UI telemetry, MCP request channels, debounced reconnect
//! notifications) keep `try_send` semantics by design and are documented
//! at their call sites; this list is intentionally small and telemetry-only.
