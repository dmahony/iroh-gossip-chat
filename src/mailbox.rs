//! Encrypted recipient-hosted store-and-forward delivery for direct messages.
//!
//! **DEPRECATED** — mailbox state is intended to move to the SQLite database
//! via the unified storage layer (Phase 13).  The JSON store remains the
//! compatibility persistence path until the mailbox tables are wired into the
//! runtime.
//!
//! A mailbox stores opaque, authenticated ciphertext.  It never decrypts a
//! message and only accepts envelopes signed by an explicitly authorized
//! sender.  Entries remain until the recipient signs an acknowledgement, or
//! until the configured retention period expires.
//!
//! # Migration
//!
//! Runtime mailbox delivery currently uses this store, so writes must remain
//! durable across shutdown/restart.  The SQLite DM tables are a separate,
//! newer direct-message model and are not yet used by the inbox frontend.
