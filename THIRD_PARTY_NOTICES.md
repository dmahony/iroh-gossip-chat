# Third-Party Notices — Boru

This file is the licensing manifest for **Boru** (this repository). It records
the project's own copyright and licence, and the individual licences and
notices of every third-party component Boru builds on or bundles, including
the upstream crates Boru modifies.

The document is deliberately split into **source licensing** (sections 1–3:
what Boru's own code and its compiled Rust dependencies are licensed under)
and **non-source third-party material** (sections 4–5: bundled assets and
redistributed native binaries, which are separate works with their own
licence obligations and are NOT covered by Boru's MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing).
Section 6 documents the automated licence gate that enforces this policy.

## 1. Boru source licensing

- **Copyright © 2026 Daniel Mahony** — all Boru modifications and additions.
- Base project: the `iroh-gossip-chat` example from the n0 team's `iroh`
  repository, **Copyright 2023 N0, INC.**
- Licence: **MIT OR Apache-2.0** (dual) — see `LICENSE-MIT` and
  `LICENSE-APACHE` at the repository root; declared in `Cargo.toml`
  (`license = "MIT/Apache-2.0"`).
- Repository: https://github.com/dmahony/boru

Boru is a modified fork of n0's `iroh-gossip-chat`. All modifications and
additions are **Copyright © 2026 Daniel Mahony** and are distributed under the
same dual licence as the base project.

## 2. Patched crates — Boru modifications of upstream crates

Boru vendors modified copies of upstream crates under `patched/` and
`noq-proto-patched/`, wired in via `[patch.crates-io]` in `Cargo.toml`. The
modifications are **by Daniel Mahony** and are licensed under the same terms
as each upstream crate. Every patched directory retains its upstream licence
text.

| Crate | Directory | Upstream licence | Upstream copyright |
|---|---|---|---|
| `iroh` | `patched/iroh` | MIT OR Apache-2.0; BSD-3-Clause for tailscale-derived parts (`LICENSE-BSD3`) | n0 team |
| `iroh-dns` | `patched/iroh-dns` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | n0 team |
| `iroh-relay` | `patched/iroh-relay` | MIT OR Apache-2.0; BSD-3-Clause for tailscale-derived parts (`LICENSE-BSD3`) | n0 team |
| `irpc` | `patched/irpc` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | N0, INC. |
| `irpc-iroh` | `patched/irpc-iroh` | Apache-2.0 OR MIT | Rüdiger Klaehn, n0 team |
| `mainline` | `patched/mainline` | MIT | raptorswing (2021) |
| `n0-mainline` | `patched/n0-mainline` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | raptorswing (2021) |
| `iced_tiny_skia` | `patched/iced_tiny_skia` | MIT | iced contributors |
| `p2panda-encryption` | `patched/p2panda-encryption` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | p2panda contributors |
| `noq-proto` | `noq-proto-patched` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | quinn developers (2018–2025), N0, Inc. (2025) |

## 3. Rust dependency tree (source dependencies)

The complete set of crates.io dependencies, their licence expressions, and
the allowed-licence policy are validated by **cargo-deny** — see `deny.toml`
(allow list) and `Cargo.lock` (full inventory). Allowed licences are:

Apache-2.0, Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause,
BSL-1.0, CC0-1.0, CDLA-Permissive-2.0, IJG, ISC, MIT, MPL-2.0, NCSA,
Unicode-3.0, Unlicense, Zlib.

Everything else — in particular the copyleft licences GPL/AGPL/LGPL/GFDL and
any licence not listed above — is **rejected** by the gate. The few crates
whose licence is not machine-declarable are handled with an explicit
clarification (`ring` in `deny.toml`).

## 4. Bundled assets

### Embedded offline GeoIP database

Desktop builds include the unmodified **DB-IP IP to City Lite, August 2026**
database. **IP Geolocation by [DB-IP](https://db-ip.com/)**, licensed under
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
([legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)).
This database is a separate work, not covered by Boru's source-code license.
The Home card includes visible provider attribution. Source, checksum, and
update instructions: [assets/geoip/README.md](assets/geoip/README.md).

| Component | Location | Licence | Notice |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fonts (Figtree, Raleway, JetBrains Mono, Archivo, IBM Plex Sans, Public Sans, Inter Tight) | `src/bin/boru/fonts/` | SIL OFL-1.1 | `src/bin/boru/fonts/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (exact versions and sources) |
| Papirus file-type icons (bundled as separate runtime asset files; **not** embedded in the binary) | `assets/third_party/papirus/` | GPL-3.0 | `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES/papirus/README.md` (full licence review), `assets/third_party/papirus/NOTICE.md` |
| Twemoji emoji graphics (bundled as separate runtime asset files; **not** embedded in the binary) | `assets/emoji/twemoji/svg/` | CC-BY 4.0 (graphics); MIT (upstream code) | `assets/emoji/twemoji/ATTRIBUTION.md` (pinned revision `v15.1.0`, commit `7407fa31`), upstream `LICENSE` + `LICENSE-GRAPHICS` kept verbatim in the same directory |
| Tabler icons (embedded in the binary via `icon_system.rs`; formerly Lucide, swapped 2026-08 — see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES/tabler/README.md`) | `assets/icons/lucide/` | MIT | `assets/icons/lucide/NOTICE.md` |

These assets are separate works distributed alongside Boru. The GPL-3.0
Papirus icons are shipped as unmodified SVG data files loaded at runtime;
they are **not** compiled into the Boru executable, so the GPL does not
extend to Boru's own MIT/Apache-2.0 code (see the aggregate-work analysis in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES/papirus/README.md`).

## 5. Redistributed native binaries (packaging-time only)

| Component | Location | Licence | Notice |
|---|---|---|---|
| GStreamer runtime + FFmpeg/GLib DLLs (Windows packaging only) | staged by `scripts/package_windows.sh` | LGPL-2.1-or-later (core/plugins/FFmpeg/GLib), BSD-3-Clause (vorbis/opus), Zlib, BSD-2-Clause (orc), bzip2 licence | `assets/third_party/gstreamer-notices/NOTICE.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES/gstreamer/README.md` |

Notes:

- **Not committed to the repository.** No `.dll`/`.so`/`.dylib` is checked
  in. GStreamer/FFmpeg binaries are only staged into a Windows release
  package at packaging time, and the exact licence texts must be copied into
  `assets/third_party/gstreamer-notices/` as part of that release build
  (see `docs/video-runtime-packaging.md`).
- **OpenH264** is used for H.264 encoding (`openh264-sys2`, BSD-2-Clause) but
  the repo redistributes **no** OpenH264 binary: `openh264-sys2` compiles the
  upstream OpenH264 source into the Boru binary at build time.
- These native binaries are separate works under their own (LGPL/BSD/etc.)
  obligations and are **not** part of Boru's MIT/Apache-2.0 source licensing.

## 6. Licence gate

Boru's source is MIT OR Apache-2.0, and the compiled dependency graph must
stay permissively licensed. This is enforced automatically:

- **Config:** `deny.toml` — the `[licenses].allow` list **is** the gate.
  cargo-deny (>= 0.18.4) denies every licence that is not explicitly listed,
  and treats GNU licences pedantically (exact SPDX expression required).
- **Local command:**
  `./scripts/check-licenses.sh` (runs
  `cargo deny check licenses --workspace --all-features`); full check:
  `./scripts/check-licenses.sh --all`.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` — the `cargo_deny` job runs
  `cargo deny --workspace --all-features check -Dwarnings` on every PR/push.

A new GPL/AGPL (or any other copyleft) dependency therefore **fails CI**.
The only way to add one is an explicit review: list it under
`[[licenses.exceptions]]` in `deny.toml` with a justification comment
(`reason`), and never add copyleft licences to the `allow` list itself.

### Verification record (2026-08-14, DEBSRV, cargo-deny 0.20.2)

Gate passes on the current tree:

```
$ cargo deny --workspace --all-features check licenses
licenses ok        (exit 0)
```

Gate rejects a GPL dependency (scratch branch adding a crate declared
`GPL-3.0-only`; dependency removed afterwards — no GPL dep in any commit):

```
error[rejected]: failed to satisfy license requirements
  ┌─ scratch-gpltest-crate/Cargo.toml:7:12
  │
7 │ license = "GPL-3.0-only"
  │            ━━━━━━━━━━━━
  │            rejected: license is not explicitly allowed
  │
  ├ GPL-3.0-only - GNU General Public License v3.0 only:

  ├   - Copyleft
  ├ gpl-test-crate v0.1.0
    └── boru-core v0.201.0

licenses FAILED    (exit 4)
```

Note: the CI `cargo_deny` job's `check` also runs the advisory check. As of
2026-08-14 that separately reports several new rustsec advisories
(RUSTSEC-2023-0089, RUSTSEC-2024-0370, RUSTSEC-2026-0150, RUSTSEC-2026-0173,
RUSTSEC-2026-0207, RUSTSEC-2026-0208, RUSTSEC-2026-0212) in existing
dependencies — these are pre-existing findings independent of the licence
gate and are triaged in section 7.

## 7. RustSec advisory triage (2026-08-14, BORU-SS-02-followup)

`cargo deny --workspace --all-features check -Dwarnings` also runs the
rustsec advisory check. The failures found on 2026-08-14 and their
disposition:

| Advisory | Type | Crate (version) | Path in | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RUSTSEC-2026-0207 | vulnerability | libcrux-sha3 0.0.8 | hpke-rs → p2panda-encryption (group encryption) | **FIXED**: hpke-rs 0.7.0 → libcrux-sha3 0.0.10 |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0208 | vulnerability | libcrux-sha3 0.0.8 | hpke-rs → p2panda-encryption (group encryption) | **FIXED**: hpke-rs 0.7.0 → libcrux-sha3 0.0.10 |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0212 | vulnerability | libcrux-secrets 0.0.5 | libcrux-traits → libcrux-sha3 → hpke-rs | **FIXED**: hpke-rs 0.7.0 → libcrux-traits 0.0.8 → libcrux-secrets 0.0.6 |
| RUSTSEC-2023-0089 | unmaintained | atomic-polyfill 1.0.3 | heapless 0.7.17 → postcard | justified ignore (see below) |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0370 | unmaintained | proc-macro-error 0.4.12 | genawaiter-proc-macro → genawaiter → bao-tree (iroh-blobs) | justified ignore (see below) |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0173 | unmaintained | proc-macro-error2 2.0.1 | hax-lib-macros (cfg(hax) only) → libcrux-sha3 | justified ignore (see below) |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0150 | unmaintained | audiopus_sys 0.2.2 | opus (voice-calls feature, optional) | justified ignore (see below) |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0206 | unmaintained | rustybuzz 0.20.1 | usvg → resvg (iced GUI) | justified ignore (see below) |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0192 | unmaintained | ttf-parser 0.25.1 | fontdb/cosmic-text/rustybuzz (iced GUI) | justified ignore (see below) |

### Vulnerability fixes (libcrux / hpke-rs)

The three vulnerability advisories are all in the libcrux crypto stack that
powers `p2panda-encryption` → `hpke-rs` (boru's group-encryption ratchet).
Upstream fixes exist:

- `libcrux-sha3 0.0.10` fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0207 (incorrect incremental
  portable SHAKE output) and RUSTSEC-2026-0208 (AVX2 SHAKE-256 panic).
- `libcrux-secrets 0.0.6` fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0212 (aarch64 constant-time
  swap/select).

The blocker: `p2panda-encryption 0.7.0` (crates.io) pins `hpke-rs ^0.6.1`,
and `hpke-rs 0.6.1` pins `libcrux-sha3 ^0.0.8` (semver `^0.0.8` means
`<0.0.9`, so the 0.0.10 fix is out of range). `hpke-rs 0.7.0` pins
`libcrux-sha3 =0.0.10` (and pulls `libcrux-traits 0.0.8` →
`libcrux-secrets 0.0.6`), but requires `p2panda-encryption` to widen its
constraint.

Fix applied (matching upstream p2panda git main, which made the same bump
with **no source change** — verified: the hpke-rs API used by p2panda —
`Hpke::new/seal/open`, `HpkePublicKey::new`, `HpkePrivateKey::new`, `Mode` —
is identical in 0.6.1 and 0.7.0):

- Vendored `p2panda-encryption 0.7.0` (exact crates.io source) into
  `patched/p2panda-encryption` with only the `hpke-rs` / `hpke-rs-crypto` /
  `hpke-rs-rust-crypto` version constraints bumped `0.6.1 → 0.7.0`; wired
  via `[patch.crates-io]` (see comment in `Cargo.toml`).
- `cargo update` resolved: hpke-rs 0.7.0, hpke-rs-crypto 0.7.0,
  hpke-rs-rust-crypto 0.7.0, libcrux-sha3 0.0.10, libcrux-secrets 0.0.6,
  libcrux-traits 0.0.8, libcrux-intrinsics 0.0.8, hax-lib 0.3.7.

Verification: `cargo deny --workspace --all-features check -Dwarnings` →
`advisories ok, bans ok, licenses ok, sources ok` (exit 0); full
`--all-features` build and `group_encryption` lib test suite (100 tests)
pass on DEBSRV.

### Justified ignores (unmaintained, no fix)

Each entry in `deny.toml` `[advisories].ignore` carries an inline reason;
summary of why each is acceptable:

- **RUSTSEC-2023-0089 atomic-polyfill** — target-gated to no-atomic
  embedded targets (avr, riscv32i/imc, thumbv6m, xtensa-esp32s2). Boru
  ships x86_64/aarch64/wasm32/android/armv7 — never compiled. No upgrade
  (heapless 0.7.17 pinned by postcard 1.1.3, both latest).
- **RUSTSEC-2024-0370 proc-macro-error** — build-time proc-macro helper via
  genawaiter-proc-macro (genawaiter → bao-tree `validate`, enabled by
  iroh-blobs). Never linked into the runtime binary; no fork exists.
- **RUSTSEC-2026-0173 proc-macro-error2** — `cfg(hax)`-gated inside
  hax-lib-macros (formal-verification toolchain); never compiled in normal
  builds.
- **RUSTSEC-2026-0150 audiopus_sys** — C shim behind `opus` (optional
  `voice-calls` feature, not in default); CMake 4.0 build break does not
  affect CI (CMake 3.x); no maintained drop-in replacement.
- **RUSTSEC-2026-0206 rustybuzz** — pinned by iced 0.14's SVG stack
  (usvg/resvg); upstream moved to skrifa but no iced-0.14-compatible
  upgrade exists.
- **RUSTSEC-2026-0192 ttf-parser** — pinned by iced 0.14's text stack
  (fontdb/cosmic-text/rustybuzz); same skrifa migration situation.

None of these are vulnerabilities; all are maintenance-only advisories with
no patched release, and none affect boru's shipped runtime behaviour.
